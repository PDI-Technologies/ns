# Claude Skill Creator

Comprehensive guide for authoring high-quality Claude skills that Claude can discover, load, and use effectively.

## Core Principles

### The Context Window is a Public Good

Your skill shares the context window with:
- System prompt
- Conversation history
- Other skills' metadata
- User's actual request

**Loading Model:**
- **Level 1** (Always loaded): `name` and `description` from frontmatter (~100 tokens per skill)
- **Level 2** (When triggered): SKILL.md body (under 5k tokens)
- **Level 3+** (As needed): Referenced files via bash (effectively unlimited)

**Best Practice:** Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines. Split into separate files when approaching this limit.

---

## Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
name: [Skill Name]
description: [One-line description with what AND when]
---
```

### Requirements

- **Required fields:** `name` and `description` (only two fields supported)
- **name:** 64 characters maximum
- **description:** 1024 characters maximum

### Description Best Practices

The description determines when Claude loads your skill. It should include:

1. **What the skill does** (capabilities)
2. **When to use it** (triggers)
3. **Key terminology** (searchable domain terms)

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use third person: "Processes Excel files" not "I can help you"
- Be specific with domain language users would search for
- Avoid generic terms like "helps" or "assists"

**Effective Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF documents or form automation.
```

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when committing code changes or creating pull requests.
```

❌ **Weak:**
```yaml
description: Helps with documents and files when needed.
```

## SKILL.md Body Structure

### Pattern 1: High-Level Guide with File References

Best for skills with multiple workflows or extensive documentation.

```markdown
# [Skill Name]

## Quick Start
[Concise instructions or code for common use case]

## Workflows
**[Workflow Name]**: See [workflows.md](workflows.md)
**[Another Workflow]**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)

## Reference
For complete API documentation, see [reference.md](reference.md)
```

### Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization

Organize by domain so Claude loads only relevant content.

```markdown
# BigQuery Analysis Skill

## Overview
Query and analyze data in BigQuery datasets.

## Documentation by Domain
**Finance metrics**: See [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Sales metrics**: See [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Product metrics**: See [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
```

**File Structure:**
```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md
    ├── sales.md
    └── product.md
```

### Pattern 3: Conditional Details with Progressive Disclosure

```markdown
## Basic Usage
[Simple instructions for common cases]

## Advanced Features
**For complex scenarios**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**For batch operations**: See [batch.md](batch.md)
**For error handling**: See [errors.md](errors.md)
```

## File Organization

### Directory Structure Examples

#### Simple Skill (Single File)
```
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

#### Skill with Documentation
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (loaded as needed)
├── examples.md (loaded as needed)
└── workflows.md (loaded as needed)
```

#### Skill with Code and Docs
```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md (main instructions)
├── FORMS.md (form-filling guide)
├── reference.md (API reference)
├── examples.md (usage examples)
└── scripts/
    ├── analyze_form.py (executed via bash, not loaded)
    ├── fill_form.py
    └── validate.py
```

### File Types and Their Strengths

| Type | Purpose | Token Cost | When to Use |
|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Instructions** (`.md`) | Flexible guidance | Loaded into context | Workflows, concepts, guidance |
| **Code** (`.py`, `.sh`, etc.) | Deterministic operations | Executed, not loaded | Utilities, validation, automation |
| **Resources** (schemas, templates) | Reference materials | Loaded on demand | Data structures, examples, templates |

---

## Progressive Disclosure Patterns

### Filesystem-Based Model

Claude navigates skills like a filesystem, reading files only when needed.

**Example workflow:**

1. User asks about revenue metrics
2. Claude reads SKILL.md, sees reference to `reference/finance.md`
3. Claude invokes bash to read just that file
4. Other files (`sales.md`, `product.md`) remain unloaded (zero context tokens)

**In SKILL.md:**
```markdown
# BigQuery Skill

## Quick reference by domain
**Revenue/billing**: [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Pipeline/opportunities**: [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Usage/features**: [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
```

### Table of Contents for Long Files

For reference files exceeding 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top.

**Example:**
```markdown
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

Claude can see the full scope even when previewing, then read the complete file or jump to sections.

---

## MCP Tool References

Always use fully qualified tool names to avoid "tool not found" errors.

**Format:** `ServerName:tool_name`

**Examples:**
```markdown
Use the `BigQuery:bigquery_schema` tool to retrieve table schemas.
Use the `GitHub:create_issue` tool to create issues.
Use the `Salesforce:query` tool to run SOQL queries.
```

**Where:**
- `BigQuery`, `GitHub`, `Salesforce` = MCP server names
- `bigquery_schema`, `create_issue`, `query` = tool names

**Why this matters:** Tool names can conflict across MCP servers. Fully qualified names ensure Claude invokes the correct tool.

---

## Testing and Iteration

### Three-Agent Testing Pattern

Use three Claude instances for rapid iteration:

1. **Claude A** (Skill Author): You describe what the skill should do
2. **Claude B** (Tester): Uses the skill in realistic scenarios
3. **You**: Observe behavior, refine based on what works/doesn't work

**Why this works:**
- Claude A understands agent needs
- You provide domain expertise
- Claude B reveals gaps through real usage
- Iterative refinement based on observed behavior vs assumptions

### Observe How Claude Navigates Skills

As you iterate, watch for:

- **Unexpected exploration paths**: Claude reads files in different order than you anticipated
  - **Fix**: Your structure may not be as intuitive as you thought

- **Missed connections**: Claude fails to follow references to important files
  - **Fix**: Make links more explicit or prominent

- **Overreliance on certain sections**: Claude repeatedly reads the same file
  - **Fix**: Consider moving that content into main SKILL.md

- **Ignored content**: Claude never accesses a bundled file
  - **Fix**: File might be unnecessary or poorly signaled

**Iterate based on these observations** to align skill structure with how Claude naturally explores it.

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Reference Multiple Files from SKILL.md

Keep SKILL.md as a navigation hub:

```markdown
# SKILL.md

**Basic usage**: [Core workflows are in this file]

**Advanced features**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**API reference**: See [reference.md](reference.md)
**Examples**: See [examples.md](examples.md)
```

### Pattern: Conditional Loading

Show basics in SKILL.md, reference details only when needed:

```markdown
## Creating documents
Use the document library to create new files.

## Editing documents
For simple edits, modify XML directly.

**For tracked changes and redlining**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
```

### Pattern: Code + Documentation

Bundle executable scripts separately:

```markdown
## Analyzing PDF forms

Run the analysis script: `python scripts/analyze_form.py <file>`

**For field extraction details**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md)
```

**File structure:**
```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── FORMS.md
└── scripts/
    └── analyze_form.py
```

Scripts execute via bash without loading content into context.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Doesn't Use My Skill

**Checklist:**
1. Is the description specific enough to trigger on your use case?
2. Does the description include key terminology users would search for?
3. Is SKILL.md in the correct location (`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`)?
4. Is the YAML frontmatter properly formatted (three dashes, required fields)?

**Test:** Ask Claude to list available skills. If yours doesn't appear, check file location and YAML syntax.

### Skill Has Errors

**Common causes:**
1. **YAML syntax errors**: Missing closing `---`, incorrect indentation
2. **File path errors**: Use forward slashes (`reference/guide.md`), relative paths from SKILL.md location
3. **Description too long**: Must be under 1024 characters

**Debug:**
1. Verify YAML frontmatter with a YAML validator
2. Check that all referenced files exist
3. Test file paths by having Claude read them directly

### Multiple Skills Conflict

**When:** Two skills have overlapping descriptions/triggers

**Solutions:**
1. Make descriptions more specific
2. Use conditional phrases: "Use when [specific scenario]"
3. Consider merging related skills into one with organized sections

---

## Security Considerations

**Only use skills from trusted sources:**
- Skills you created yourself
- Skills from Anthropic
- Skills from verified, trusted sources

**Why:** Skills provide Claude with new capabilities through instructions and code. A malicious skill can direct Claude to invoke tools or execute code in unintended ways.

**If using untrusted skills:**
1. Thoroughly audit all files
2. Check all code for malicious operations
3. Verify tool invocations match stated purpose
4. Test in isolated environment first
