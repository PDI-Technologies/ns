3. **Test [FEATURE_1]**:
   - [ACTION_1 - e.g., "Click the submit button"]
   - [ACTION_2 - e.g., "Enter text in the email field"]
   - Observe [EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR - e.g., "form validates and shows success message"]

4. **Test [FEATURE_2]**:
   - [ACTION_1]
   - [ACTION_2]
   - Verify [EXPECTED_OUTCOME]

5. **Test [FEATURE_3]**:
   - [ACTION_1]
   - [ACTION_2]
