# Finance Automation Case Study

Real-world scenario demonstrating automated month-end close, journal entries, and revenue recognition.

## Scenario: Month-End Close Automation

### Business Context

**Company:** Mid-size SaaS company with $50M annual revenue
**Challenge:** Manual month-end close taking 8-10 business days
**Pain Points:**
- Manual accrual entries (40+ journal entries per month)
- Revenue recognition for subscription contracts
- Intercompany eliminations across 3 subsidiaries
- Reconciliation delays
- CFO demanding faster close (target: 3 days)

### Solution Implementation

**Phase 1: Accrual Automation (Month 1-2)**

Automated accrual journal entries for:
- Unbilled revenue (completed projects not yet invoiced)
- Unpaid expenses (vendor bills not yet received)
- Payroll accruals (period-end cutoff)

**Scripts Deployed:**
- Scheduled Script: Daily accrual calculations
- User Event Script: Auto-reverse accruals next period
- Workflow: Route large accruals for CFO approval

**Results:**
- Accrual processing time: 6 hours → 30 minutes (92% reduction)
- Accrual errors: 8 per month → 0
- Journal entries: 40/month → 4 (manual only for exceptions)

**Phase 2: Revenue Recognition (Month 3-4)**

Implemented ASC 606 compliance automation:
- Point-in-time recognition for one-time sales
- Ratable recognition for annual subscriptions
- Milestone-based recognition for professional services

**Scripts Deployed:**
- Scheduled Script: Monthly revenue recognition calculations
- User Event Script: Revenue schedule creation on invoice
- Map/Reduce Script: Bulk recognition for 1,000+ contracts

**Results:**
- Revenue recognition time: 2 days → 4 hours (75% reduction)
- Compliance confidence: Medium → High (auditor approved)
- Deferred revenue accuracy: 98% → 100%

### Final Results

**Month-End Close Timeline:**
- Day 1: Accruals posted automatically (was Day 1-3)
- Day 2: Revenue recognition processed (was Day 4-6)
- Day 3: Reconciliations and CFO review (was Day 7-10)

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 10 business days
- After: 3 business days
- **Reduction: 70%**

**Staff Impact:**
- Controller time freed: 20 hours/month
- Accounting team time freed: 40 hours/month
- **Total annual time savings: 720 hours**

**Audit Benefits:**
- Clean audit with no findings
- Auditor commended "robust automation controls"
- Audit fee reduced by $15K due to fewer testing hours

## Code Examples

**Accrual Automation:**
```javascript
// Scheduled Script: Create accruals for unbilled time
function accrueUnbilledTime(periodId) {
    const unbilledTime = search.create({
        type: search.Type.TIME_BILL,
        filters: [
            ['isbillable', 'is', 'T'],
            'AND',
            ['billingtransaction', 'anyof', '@NONE@']
        ],
        columns: [
            search.createColumn({ name: 'hours', summary: search.Summary.SUM }),
            search.createColumn({ name: 'rate', summary: search.Summary.AVG }),
            'customer', 'class'
        ]
    }).run();

    unbilledTime.each((result) => {
        const amount = result.getValue({ name: 'hours', summary: search.Summary.SUM }) *
                       result.getValue({ name: 'rate', summary: search.Summary.AVG });

        createAccrualJE({
            amount: amount,
            customer: result.getValue({ name: 'customer' }),
            class: result.getValue({ name: 'class' }),
            period: periodId
        });

        return true;
    });
}
```
