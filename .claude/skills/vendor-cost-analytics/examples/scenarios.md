# Real-World Vendor Analytics Scenarios

Business scenarios demonstrating the practical application of vendor analytics for cost optimization and decision-making.

## Overview

Vendor analytics delivers measurable business value across procurement, finance, and operations by transforming NetSuite transaction data into actionable insights.

**Common Outcomes:**
- 10-30% reduction in vendor count through consolidation
- 3-7% cost savings from duplicate elimination and volume discounts
- 50-80% time savings in vendor spend reporting
- Improved payment terms capture (95%+ discount capture rate)
- Enhanced vendor relationship management

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Finance teams (budget planning, audit preparation)
- Procurement teams (vendor negotiation, consolidation)
- AP teams (duplicate prevention, payment optimization)
- Executive leadership (spend visibility, cost control)

## Scenario 1: Quarterly Vendor Spend Review

### Business Context

**Challenge:**
Finance team needs to review top vendor spending before quarterly business reviews (QBRs). NetSuite saved searches are slow to run (5-10 minutes), difficult to customize, and require manual export to Excel for analysis. The CFO wants spend data ranked by vendor with year-over-year comparison.

**Current State:**
- Manual process taking 2-3 hours per quarter
- Data scattered across multiple NetSuite saved searches
- Excel pivots built from scratch each quarter
- Inconsistent formatting between quarters
- Delay in getting insights to leadership

### Solution

**Implementation:**
1. Sync vendor and transaction data from NetSuite (5 minutes)
2. Run automated spend analysis grouped by vendor (30 seconds)
3. Generate top 25 vendors report with rankings
4. Export to CSV for presentation deck

**Analysis Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    v.company_name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_spend,
    COUNT(t.id) AS transaction_count,
    AVG(t.amount) AS avg_transaction
FROM
    vendor_records v
JOIN
    transaction_records t ON v.id = t.vendor_id
WHERE
    t.transaction_date >= '2024-01-01'
    AND t.transaction_date < '2024-04-01'
    AND t.status != 'Voided'
GROUP BY
    v.company_name
ORDER BY
    total_spend DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### Results

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 2-3 hours of manual work per quarter
- After: 10 minutes (5 min sync + 5 min analysis and formatting)
- **Annual time savings: 8-12 hours** (4 quarters)

**Data Quality:**
- Consistent formatting quarter over quarter
- Automated ranking and calculations
- Eliminates manual Excel errors
- Historical trend tracking enabled

**Business Impact:**
- CFO receives vendor spend insights 1 week earlier
- Finance team capacity freed for higher-value analysis
- Consistent metrics enable better trend identification

## Scenario 2: Vendor Consolidation Project

### Business Context

**Challenge:**
Multiple departments are independently working with similar vendors under different names. For example:
- IT department uses "Tech Solutions Inc"
- Marketing uses "Tech Solutions LLC"
- Operations uses "TechSolutions"

This fragmentation results in:
- Lost volume discounts (each department negotiates separately)
- Split payment terms (inconsistent terms across entities)
- Inaccurate vendor spend reporting
- Difficulty tracking total vendor exposure

**Current State:**
- 1,247 active vendors in NetSuite
- Estimated 15-20% duplication based on manual review
- No systematic duplicate detection process
- Department heads unaware of overlap

### Solution

**Implementation:**
1. Extract all active vendors from NetSuite
2. Run duplicate detection with 0.85 similarity threshold
3. Manually review high-confidence matches (>0.90 similarity)
4. Validate with department stakeholders
5. Consolidate vendors in NetSuite
6. Negotiate improved terms based on combined volume

**Duplicate Detection Algorithm:**

```python
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

def detect_duplicates(vendors, threshold=0.85):
    duplicates = []
    for i, v1 in enumerate(vendors):
        for v2 in vendors[i+1:]:
            similarity = SequenceMatcher(
                None,
                v1.name.lower(),
                v2.name.lower()
            ).ratio()

            if similarity >= threshold:
                duplicates.append({
                    'vendor_1': v1.name,
                    'vendor_2': v2.name,
                    'similarity': similarity,
                    'combined_spend': v1.spend + v2.spend
                })

    return sorted(duplicates, key=lambda d: d['combined_spend'], reverse=True)
```

### Results

**Duplicate Detection Findings:**
- 187 potential duplicate pairs identified (threshold 0.85)
- 47 high-confidence duplicates confirmed (threshold >0.90)
- 23 duplicates validated and consolidated
- 164 false positives reviewed and dismissed

**Vendor Count Reduction:**
- Before: 1,247 active vendors
- After: 1,224 active vendors (23 consolidated)
- **Reduction: 1.8%** (modest, but focused on high-spend vendors)

**Financial Impact:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total addressable spend (23 duplicate pairs) | $847,000 annually |
| Baseline consolidation savings (3%) | $25,410 |
| Volume discount improvement | $18,200 |
| Administrative cost reduction (23 vendors Ã— $750) | $17,250 |
| **Total annual savings** | **$60,860** |
| **3-year NPV** | **$152,150** |

**Payment Terms Improvement:**
- 8 vendors upgraded from "Net 30" to "2/10 Net 30" based on combined volume
- Annual discount capture opportunity: $16,940
- Effective APR of early payment discount: 36.7% (strong ROI)

**Process Improvements:**
- Established quarterly duplicate detection review
- Vendor onboarding checklist includes duplicate check
- Department heads now coordinate before engaging new vendors

## Scenario 3: Audit Preparation

### Business Context

**Challenge:**
Annual financial audit requires detailed vendor spend breakdowns by:
- Top 50 vendors by spend
- Vendor payment terms distribution
- Year-over-year spend variance analysis
- Transaction count by vendor

Generating these reports from NetSuite requires:
- Multiple saved searches with different criteria
- Manual consolidation in Excel
- Cross-referencing vendor records with transactions
- Time-consuming validation

**Current State:**
- 6-8 hours to prepare vendor audit schedules
- Auditors request additional breakdowns (more hours)
- Tight audit timeline creates pressure

### Solution

**Implementation:**
1. Pre-audit data sync (vendors + full year transactions)
2. Run pre-built audit report templates
3. Generate CSV exports for auditor workpapers
4. Answer follow-up questions via ad-hoc queries

**Audit Report Queries:**

```sql
-- Top 50 vendors by spend
SELECT
    v.entity_id,
    v.company_name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_spend_2024,
    COUNT(t.id) AS transaction_count
FROM vendor_records v
JOIN transaction_records t ON v.id = t.vendor_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.transaction_date) = 2024
GROUP BY v.entity_id, v.company_name
ORDER BY total_spend_2024 DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Payment terms distribution
SELECT
    v.terms,
    COUNT(DISTINCT v.id) AS vendor_count,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_spend
FROM vendor_records v
JOIN transaction_records t ON v.id = t.vendor_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.transaction_date) = 2024
GROUP BY v.terms
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;

-- Year-over-year variance
WITH spend_2023 AS (
    SELECT vendor_id, SUM(amount) AS spend
    FROM transaction_records
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY vendor_id
),
spend_2024 AS (
    SELECT vendor_id, SUM(amount) AS spend
    FROM transaction_records
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2024
    GROUP BY vendor_id
)
SELECT
    v.company_name,
    COALESCE(s23.spend, 0) AS spend_2023,
    COALESCE(s24.spend, 0) AS spend_2024,
    COALESCE(s24.spend, 0) - COALESCE(s23.spend, 0) AS variance,
    CASE
        WHEN s23.spend > 0 THEN
            ((s24.spend - s23.spend) / s23.spend * 100)
        ELSE NULL
    END AS variance_pct
FROM vendor_records v
LEFT JOIN spend_2023 s23 ON v.id = s23.vendor_id
LEFT JOIN spend_2024 s24 ON v.id = s24.vendor_id
WHERE COALESCE(s23.spend, 0) > 0 OR COALESCE(s24.spend, 0) > 0
ORDER BY ABS(COALESCE(s24.spend, 0) - COALESCE(s23.spend, 0)) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Results

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 6-8 hours for initial audit schedules + 2-4 hours for follow-ups
- After: 1 hour for initial reports + 30 minutes for ad-hoc queries
- **Total time savings: 7-10 hours per audit**

**Audit Quality:**
- Consistent data across all audit schedules
- Automated variance calculations eliminate Excel errors
- Faster turnaround on auditor requests
- Auditors commend data quality and responsiveness

**Stakeholder Satisfaction:**
- Finance team stress reduced during audit season
- Audit completed 2 days ahead of schedule
- CFO receives clean audit opinion

## Scenario 4: Payment Terms Optimization

### Business Context

**Challenge:**
Company has \$12.5M annual vendor spend but inconsistent payment terms:
- 45% of vendors on "Net 30" (no discount)
- 30% on "Net 60" (extended terms, no discount)
- 15% on "2/10 Net 30" (discount available)
- 10% on other or unknown terms

Current discount capture rate is only 62% (missing 38% of available discounts due to payment timing issues).

**Goals:**
1. Identify all discount opportunities
2. Calculate ROI of taking early payment discounts
3. Improve discount capture rate to 95%+

### Solution

**Implementation:**
1. Analyze payment terms distribution across vendors
2. Identify vendors offering early payment discounts
3. Calculate effective APR of discount opportunities
4. Prioritize high-spend vendors with attractive discount terms
5. Automate payment scheduling to hit discount windows

**Payment Terms Analysis:**

```python
import re

def parse_discount_terms(terms: str) -> dict | None:
    """Parse '2/10 Net 30' format."""
    match = re.match(r'(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)/(\d+)\s+Net\s+(\d+)', terms, re.IGNORECASE)
    if match:
        return {
            'discount_percent': float(match.group(1)) / 100,
            'discount_days': int(match.group(2)),
            'net_days': int(match.group(3))
        }
    return None

def calculate_effective_apr(discount_percent: float, discount_days: int, net_days: int) -> float:
    """Calculate effective APR of early payment discount."""
    days_early = net_days - discount_days
    return (discount_percent / (1 - discount_percent)) * (365 / days_early)

# Example: 2/10 Net 30
# Effective APR = (0.02 / 0.98) * (365 / 20) = 37.2%
```

### Results

**Discount Opportunity Analysis:**

| Terms | Vendor Count | Annual Spend | Discount % | Potential Savings | Effective APR |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 2/10 Net 30 | 142 | $1,875,000 | 2% | $37,500 | 37.2% |
| 1/15 Net 45 | 23 | $456,000 | 1% | $4,560 | 12.2% |
| 3/10 Net 30 | 8 | $287,000 | 3% | $8,610 | 59.1% |
| **Total** | **173** | **$2,618,000** | - | **$50,670** | - |

**Recommendations:**
- Take all discounts with effective APR >15% (company cost of capital)
- Focus on "3/10 Net 30" vendors first (highest APR)
- Automate payment scheduling for "2/10 Net 30" vendors
- Monitor discount capture rate weekly

**Implementation Outcome:**
- Discount capture rate improved from 62% to 96%
- Annual savings realized: $48,640 (96% of $50,670 potential)
- Payment automation reduced manual AP workload by 12 hours/month

**Cash Flow Impact:**
- Accelerating payments reduced average DPO from 45 days to 38 days
- Cash flow impact: $260,000 tied up earlier (one-time working capital need)
- Trade-off: Discount savings of $48K/year justify the working capital investment (18.7% return)

## Scenario 5: Budget Planning and Forecasting

### Business Context

**Challenge:**
Finance team is preparing the 2025 annual budget and needs to forecast vendor expenses. Historical spend data is scattered across NetSuite saved searches, and trending is done manually in Excel. Need to:
- Identify vendors with significant spend growth
- Forecast 2025 spend based on historical trends
- Allocate budget across departments based on vendor usage

**Current State:**
- Manual data extraction from NetSuite (3 hours)
- Excel trend analysis (2 hours)
- Department-level allocation requires additional saved searches (2 hours)
- Total effort: 7 hours

### Solution

**Implementation:**
1. Extract 3 years of transaction history
2. Calculate monthly spend trends by vendor
3. Identify vendors with >20% YoY growth
4. Forecast 2025 spend using linear regression
5. Export results for budget worksheets

**Trend Analysis Query:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

def forecast_vendor_spend(database_url: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Forecast 2025 vendor spend based on historical trends."""
    engine = create_engine(database_url)

    query = """
        SELECT
            v.company_name,
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.transaction_date) AS year,
            SUM(t.amount) AS total_spend
        FROM vendor_records v
        JOIN transaction_records t ON v.id = t.vendor_id
        WHERE t.transaction_date >= '2022-01-01'
        GROUP BY v.company_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.transaction_date)
        ORDER BY v.company_name, year
    """

    df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

    # Calculate YoY growth
    df['yoy_growth'] = df.groupby('company_name')['total_spend'].pct_change()

    # Simple linear forecast (average of past 3 years + growth trend)
    forecasts = df.groupby('company_name').agg({
        'total_spend': 'mean',
        'yoy_growth': 'mean'
    }).reset_index()

    forecasts['forecast_2025'] = forecasts['total_spend'] * (1 + forecasts['yoy_growth'])

    return forecasts.nlargest(50, 'forecast_2025')
```

### Results

**High-Growth Vendors Identified:**

| Vendor | 2023 Spend | 2024 Spend | YoY Growth | 2025 Forecast |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Cloud Services LLC | $52,400 | $78,600 | 50% | $117,900 |
